Your response goes here!

I had a basic knowledge of HTML to begin with, but this challenge course taught me about a lot of new attributes.
Following the tutorials throughout to complete the goals were easy.
Did face some minor bugs while rendering and matching my outputs with the desired outputs, but still done with it.
The forums has been of great help.
